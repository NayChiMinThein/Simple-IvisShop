# Simple-IvisShop
NOTE: This is just my personal practice project with react.

"I've created a simple React shop app for practice, as I'm new to React. Although it's not a big project, I've focused on improving the user experience. I've enhanced the UI with smoother animations for the sale modal and organized the code into manageable components for better understanding, even for beginners. I'm excited to upload this to my Git repository to mark my journey in learning React. The code is kept concise and beginner-friendly. Your feedback is welcome!"
